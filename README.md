# Privacy-Preserving Credit Card Fraud Detection using Homomorphic Encryption

This repo contains the source code of an implementation of a credit card fraud detector which uses private ML inference on encrypted transactions. Paper including intructions on how to run the implementation to be released soon.

The `src` folder contains the necessary source code. Also included in this folder is [Privacy-Preserving XGBoost Inference](https://github.com/awslabs/privacy-preserving-xgboost-inference.git) with some minor changes. It is currently included in the repo due to dependency issues, but this will be refactored.
